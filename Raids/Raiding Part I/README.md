# Raid Quest (Solo): Adventuring Part I
**`Quest giver: Loremain Dibbs`**
>Oh my! You must be the one helping Governor Nighthill with the new technology, I can feel the power within you... No I can't, don't be absurd.  He sent word that you would be heading this way. Governor Nighthill did ask me to test your abilities. He requests me to start keeping tale of triumphs and setbacks. Let us not waste any more time and begin creating your story. There are a series of tasks for you to complete that will be your first chapter, but definitely not your last. I have a suspicion that we will be meeting again... about seven or eight more times at least. Good luck traveler.

## Objectives required to complete
**Complete any five of these you wish.  Only five in total need to be completed.**

When it comes to Heroic Quests throughout the year knowledge from Bronze Tier and Gold Tier are used for a majority of the questions that are created.  For every two problems correctly completed in `Gold Tier` or higher an extra point will be awarded to the final grade.

### Objective 1 - Looking at the problems
For these quests it is important to look over all the problems first.  Sometimes you may find a higher tier problem "easier" than a lower tier problem.  Sometimes you might not.

It is important to at least look over all the problems before picking your five.

### Objective 2 - The Problems
#### Iron Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Iron - 2`.

- [ ] **1.** Store your name and favorite song into separate String variables and print out a message that states the following using variable names: `Hello my name is NAME and my favorite song is SONG`
- [ ] **2.** Create a variable holding your favorite number.  Write an if-else statement that will determine if your number is even or odd and print out a message to the user accordingly: `NUMBER is even` or `NUMBER is odd`
- [ ] **3.** Using variables convert 23 degrees Celsius to its equivalent in Fahrenheit.  However, the Fahrenheit number should be a whole number only no decimals, not even `.0` allowed.  Print out a message like the following: `Did you know the CELSIUS degrees Celsius is equal to FAHRENHEIT degrees Fahrenheit.`.
- [ ] **4.** Take two different floating point numbers from a user.  Only have one `Scanner` taking in these numbers.  Substract the first number from the second number.  Once the difference is calculated print out the result with a user friendly phrase.

#### Bronze Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Bronze - 1`.

- [ ] **1.** Take in a person's name and age.  Based on their age determine what year of High School they are in.  We will say 14 and under is a Freshman, 15 is a Sophomore, 16 or 17 is a Junior, and 18 is a Senior.  You should have a message print to the user that displays their name and what year they are in High School.
- [ ] **2.** Take in four numbers from the user. Find the maximum and minimum number the user entered.  Print out the maximum and minimum numbers found.  You may only use if/else statements when solving this problem.
- [ ] **3.** Take in a series of numbers from the user and display to them if the number they entered is even or odd.  You should continue taking numbers from the user until they enter a sentinel value of -999 to quit.

#### Gold Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Gold - 1`.

- [ ] **1.** Take in a series of numbers from the user and calculate the sum of those numbers.  You should continue taking in values from the user until they enter a sentinel value of -999 to quit. Once they have quit you should display a message to the user indicating the how many numbers they entered, the sum of those numbers, and the average of their entries.
- [ ] **2.** Take in a person's birth year and determine if they were born on a leap year or not.  You should create a boolean variable called `isLeapBaby` that will hold the answer of if they were born on a leap year or not.  Write a check on `isLeapBaby` and print out a message that lets the user know if they are a leap baby or not.
- [ ] **3.** Take in a value from the user, should not be larger than 50.  Calculate the sum from 1 to the value the user selected.  Print out the sum with user friendly phrasing.

#### Onyx Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Onyx - 1`.

- [ ] **1.** Have the user select which base they would like to provide a number in either (decimal or binary) and then have the user select which base they would like to convert their entry into (decimal, binary, hexadecimal).  Take in the number from the user [you may assume they will give you a valid number for the base they selected] convert the user's number into their desired base.  Display a message showing them the original number, and their converted number.

### Objective 3 - Pushing
As we complete these problems we need edit this README file.  This is easiest to do within IntelliJ and then to "add, commit, and push" the changes to the README back to GitHub.

The edit should involve the following:
- Place X's in between the [ ] next to the problems solved
- No spaces between the [ ] once the X is in there

This will mark that problem with a checkmark.

Receiving a grade on any lab means our code needs to be on GitHub correctly.  This means in the same folder structure.  Do not worry if you push your code it will be in the same folder structure.

- Push all your commits to GitHub
- Ensure that your main branch has the latest code
    - Only code graded on the main branch will count

#### Grading
|   Points     |   Requirement                                      |
| :----------: |:-------------------------------------------------- |
| 8            | Five problems completed                            |
| 2            | README changed to include X's for problems solved  |
