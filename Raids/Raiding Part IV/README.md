# Raid Quest (Solo): Adventuring Part IV
**`Quest giver: Loremaster Dibbs`**
>The way you handled that last series of problems was glorious.  You are well on your way to becoming a legend before your tale is even finished.  You have several people already talking about your accomplishments.  At your midpoint with only a couple more obstacles left I feel you are on your way to that legend status.  Good luck traveler.

## Objectives required to complete
**Complete any five of these you wish.  Only five in total need to be completed.**

When it comes to Heroic Quests throughout the year knowledge from Bronze Tier and Gold Tier are used for a majority of the questions that are created.  Correctly completing all three `Bronze Tier` problems or for every two problems correctly completed in `Gold Tier` or higher an extra point will be awarded to the final grade.

### Objective 1 - Looking at the problems
For these quests it is important to look over all the problems first.  Sometimes you may find a higher tier problem "easier" than a lower tier problem.  Sometimes you might not.

It is important to at least look over all the problems before picking your five.

### Objective 2 - The Problems
#### Iron Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Iron - 2`.

- [x] **1.** Create an integer array of 25 elements that stores the squares of each index number.  For example index 2 would have the value 4, index 3 would have the value 9, etc.
- [ ] **2.** Create an integer array that holds 10 values.  Write a method that takes an int value and a location.  The purpose of this method is to store the passed value into a specific location.  You can overwrite the value that is currently in that index.
- [x] **3.** Create an integer array that holds 10 values.  Write and implement a method that takes an integer array as a parameter.  This method should calculate and print all the elements in an array multiplied together

#### Bronze Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Bronze - 1`.

- [x] **1.** Create a String array filled with 5 words.  Write and implement a method that takes a String array and a word as parameters.  This method should return true or false depending upon if the passed array contains the passed word.
- [ ] **2.** Read from the text-file "bronze2.txt" and store all the values into an array of the correct type.  Write and implement a method that takes an array matching the type of the one you created and also takes a value, again matching the data type of what is being stored in the array.  If that value exists in the array then remove it from the array by placing an appropriate default value for the data type.  This method should have a return type that will allow this to impact the original passed in array
- [x] **3.** Read from the text-file "bronze3.txt" and create an array to hold the values.  The values in this file are separated by two dashes "--" there are two values per line in this file.  Write and implement a method that takes the made array and reverses its order meaning that the last element becomes the first element.

#### Gold Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Gold - 3`.

- [x] **1.** Create an array to store the following words: wildflowers, wildlife, wildcards, wildwoods, and wildcat.  Write and implement a method that takes the array as a parameter and prints out the array without the word "wild".
- [ ] **2.** Create a String or integer array that holds 10 values.  Write and implement a method that will find and print out all the duplicate values from the array.
- [ ] **3.** Create an integer array to store 10 values.  Write and implement a method that takes the array and a sum value.  Print out all the pairs of elements whose sum matches the specified passed value.

#### Onyx Tier Problems
If you do not understand what a problem is requiring please ask for clarification instead of skipping it completely as it could be easier than it reads.

When solving any of these problems place comments in the code to indicate the problem being solved.  The comment should look something like `Onyx - 1`.

- [ ] **1.** Create an array of 10 String values that are people's names, do this with an initializer list.  Create a method that takes in a name and returns if that person is "Invited" or "Not invited" to the party.  The user should get to enter as many names as they wish to see who is invited or not until they enter a sentinel value.
- [ ] **2.** Create an array of 8 integer values.  Fill this array randomly with only 0's and 1's.  Print out the array so it appears as a binary number.  This means that index 0 should print out on the far right of this number.  You should then calculate and print out the decimal value of the binary number.  This should all be done in a method.

### Objective 3 - Pushing
As we complete these problems we need edit this README file.  This is easiest to do within IntelliJ and then to "add, commit, and push" the changes to the README back to GitHub.

The edit should involve the following:
- Place X's in between the [ ] next to the problems solved
- No spaces between the [ ] once the X is in there

This will mark that problem with a checkmark.

Receiving a grade on any lab means our code needs to be on GitHub correctly.  This means in the same folder structure.  Do not worry if you push your code it will be in the same folder structure.

- Push all your commits to GitHub
- Ensure that your main branch has the latest code
  - Only code graded on the main branch will count

#### Grading
|   Points     |   Requirement                                      |
| :----------: |:-------------------------------------------------- |
| 8            | Five problems completed                            |
| 2            | README changed to include X's for problems solved  |
