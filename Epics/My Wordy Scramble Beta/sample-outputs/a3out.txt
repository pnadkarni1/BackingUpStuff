Welcome to the Word Finder Program

Here is how to play:
        For each round you will see a randomly selected word.
        You will have 1 minute to find as many words as you can
        that can be generated with the letters in your random
        word.  Your words do not have to use all of the letters
        in the word but they must be valid words
