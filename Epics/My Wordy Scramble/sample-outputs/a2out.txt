Welcome to the Word Finder Program

Here is how to play:
	For each round you will see a randomly selected word.
	You will have 1 minute to find as many words as you can
	that can be generated with the letters in your random
	word.  Your words do not have to use all of the letters
	in the word but they must be valid words.  You will receive
	a point for each letter in each word, so longer words count
	more than shorter words.
