# Practice Quest: A New Beginning
**`Quest giver: Frost Limesprite`**
>Oh... I don't recognize you... hold on... ahem... WELCOME TRAVELER! It is not often that somebody passes my residence.  Now that I think of it, it has probably been around one year since I have last seen a traveler.  I will gladly help you test your new abilities.  Hmmm, yes, yes, I think you would be capable of handling this.  I hope you are good at making lists.

### Objectives required to complete
#### Objective 1 - Cloning
- Clone this repo into IntelliJ
    - remember to place it into a correct folder

If you are having difficulty doing the clone or are unsure about how to get it into a different folder please ask.

#### Objective 3 - Branching from the main
- Click on the word "Git" in the bottom left corner of IntelliJ
    - Right-click on the word "main"
    - Choose "New branch from selected"
- On the popup name the branch `dev`
    - Leave the checkmark in "Checkout Branch"
    - Click "Create"

Now we have our `dev` branch, we double-check the bottom right corner it should say `dev`, not main.

We can now work on this `dev` branch.

#### Objective 4 - Top List
- Make a list of print statements of your top 10 favorite movies and/or shows (google if you can't think of 10)
    - add a commit after every three movies

Print statements are written as `System.out.println();`. In between the (), we place variables or words we wish to print.  When printing words we wrap them between ""; therefore the statement would look something like `System.out.println("Words that will appear on the console exactly as they are typed here");`

#### Objective 5 - Merging to main
- Click on the word "Git" in the bottom left corner of IntelliJ
- Select "main" (it should only say main)
  - Right-click and select "Checkout"
- It should now say "main" in the bottom right corner
- main should also have the checkout tag on it in this "Git" window
- Select the "dev" branch in this Git window
    - Right-click and select "Merge Selected into Current"
- Put a checkmark in the `dev` option
    - Only select the `dev` branch with no other words as this is our local version
- Click the merge button

#### Objective 6 - Pushing back to GitHub
- Push all your commits to GitHub on both the main and dev branches
    - It does not hurt to do a final "add and commit" before pushing to verify the latest version is up on GitHub

The committing and pushing process does not change for different branches it is always the same.  If you are confused or struggling with this process please reach out and let me know.
