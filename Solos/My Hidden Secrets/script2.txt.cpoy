LUCIA: What do you do for a living?
ARNOLD: I manage the land.
LUCIA: Youre a real estate guy. I figured youd be something like that. I work at a nail salon. Im really great with nails, always been great with nails. Wanted to be an artist originally like a great painter but settled on doing nails. I get loads of compliments too, cause of the detail. See, thats the thing about it, life is in the details. Most people forget the details, like when Steve Jobs and his team signed their names inside the original Apple computers, thats detail, right? And when I paint tiny stars, or trees or cats and dogs for my clients, thats detail and I get good tips for that kind of level of work.
ARNOLD: Youre incredible.
LUCIA: Im a nail technician.
ARNOLD: And that makes you incredible. Can you paint my nails?
LUCIA: Really? Well, I guess I can if..(she searches her bag) Ah! Youre in luck. I usually carry a few colors of nail polish with me wherever I go. It keeps me calm just knowing theyre with me. Like a comfort thing. If something goes wrong, I whip them out and I get to painting my nails and I can breathe clearly again. I get anxiety. Do you care what color I use on you?
ARNOLD: Not at all.
LUCIA: Cool.
Lucia begins painting Arnolds nails.
ARNOLD: Fascinating.
LUCIA: Yeah, started doing this since I could walk and talk. And since the moon is out, Im going to place a tiny moon right there on your pinkie as a reminder of our special night.
ARNOLD: Youre too kind.
