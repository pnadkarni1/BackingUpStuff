# Raid Quest (Solo): My First Push
**`Quest giver: Governor Nighthill`**
>Dagnabbit, how does this futuristic thing work?  Somebody tried explaining it but all I heard was jibber-jabber.  I can save something and push it to somewhere else?  I don't move anything myself, I only hit a button or two... sounds like sorcery!  I don't like it, I want nothing to do with it.  You figure it out and deal with it.

## Objectives required to complete
This introductory lab is to ensure that the cloning process, workflow, and submitting process can be completed smoothly.

If any issues occur during this process please refer to the GitHub Setup videos on YouTube (linked below for convenience).

As always ask me for assistance or clarification on any steps, the videos are there as a secondary assistance tool if needed.

This quest can be decomposed into four parts for those who prefer chunking (it is recommended to use decomposition on assignments so practicing on a simple assignment can help you start to hone these skills).

| Part Number      | Description                               |
| ---------------  | :--------------------------------------:  |
| Part 1           | Read this file                            |
| Part 2           | Get repo into IntelliJ                    |
| Part 3           | Completing raid tasks                     |
| Part 4           | Completing the raid                       |

## Part 1 - Reading through
### Objective 0 - How to use READMEs
We should have a small amount of comfort with Git and GitHub after our past couple lectures.  This is the first time working through GitHub and submitting for a grade.

Whenever we receive a new project we should read over the entire README first to get an idea of what requirements we must meet.

## Part 2 - Getting this repo into IntelliJ
### Objective 1 - Cloning
Once we have read this document over and know our requirements we should start moving this project into IntelliJ, and we may begin coding.

This can be done from the main view page for the repository.  The button that reads `Clone or download` (should be green) must be clicked on to get the link needed.

- Clone this project into IntelliJ
    - remember to place it into a correct folder

If you are having difficulty doing the clone or are unsure about how to get it into a different folder please ask.

## Part 3 - Completing the raiding tasks
### Objective 1 - Main Method
This lab does not need us to create a class as there is one already provided.  The class is under src -> main -> java, if you drop down all those folders you will see `MyFirstPush` double-click on that file to open it.

However, to run our code or any code we need to create a main method.  All our Java labs in this course require a main method to be created somewhere.

It will be specified where to create the main within the objectives of each lab.

- Create a main method in the `MyFirstPush` class
    - main method should be between the {} of the class

The specifics for the main method can be seen on the code handout paper you will be receiving with this lab.

### Objective 2 - Copying Code
As the overall purpose of this lab is to ease us into and to test the GitHub workflow, a physical handout will have some code for you to copy.  If we are not in school, or you did not get a physical handout there will be a code picture on the Schoology assignment.

Make sure when copying from the paper you include all the necessary `() "" ;` missing any of these will cause your code to have errors and not run.

- Copy the code on the paper handout given to you
- Run the code to see the outputs
    - right-click somewhere in the code file and select the `Run MyFirstPush.main()` it will have a little play symbol next to the option

## Part 4 - Completing the quest
### Objective 1 - Pushing
Receiving a grade on any lab means our code needs to be on GitHub correctly.  This means in the same folder structure.  Do not worry if you push your code it will be in the same folder structure.

This submitting phase is a three-step process: **`add, commit, and push`**.

We will not have to do any adding for this assignment.  However, you will need to commit. Remember the commit and push options can be found on the side panel inside IntelliJ.

Without doing these three steps our code will not be on GitHub.  This can then cause delays or penalties on our overall grade for a lab.  The "submitting" process is important to do.  As you should have been adding and committing through the entire lab (as you completed prior objectives) all that is left to do down here is a final push.

- Push all your commits to GitHub
    - It does not hurt to do a final "add and commit" before pushing to verify the latest version is up on GitHub

If you are struggling with these steps please ask.

#### Grading
|   Points   |   Requirement                               |
| :--------: |:------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | main method correct                         |
| 2          | all code from handout copied correctly      |
| 1          | push back to GitHub for grading             |
| 1          | more than a single commit made to the repo  |
