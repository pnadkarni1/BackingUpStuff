Mr. Berguer: Please, take a seat Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Sanders: I rather stand but Ill be polite.
Mr. Berguer:  Appreciated.  (beat) What do you think of the party tonight?
Mr. Sanders: Its becoming of you.  Your typical bourgeois nonsense.
Mr. Berguer: Yes, it is quite a bit of nonsense, I must agree but necessary nonsense Im afraid.  Can I offer you a cigar?  My collection spans the globe.
Mr. Sanders: I dont smoke.
Mr. Berguer: Pity.
(Berguer lights his cigar)
May I offer you a drink?  Surely, you drink.  Scotch? Brandy?
Mr. Sanders: Bourbon.
Mr. Berguer: My pleasure.
(Berguer pours Sanders bourbon)
You may be wondering why Ive asked you to come here.
Mr. Sanders: Actually, I know exactly why youve sent for me.
Mr. Berguer: Do tell.
Mr. Sanders: Patents.
Mr. Berguer: Yes, that is correct.  The patents.
Mr. Sanders: Perhaps we should cut to the chase, Mr. Berguer.  We are both business men, are we not?  No need to beat around the bush.
Mr. Berguer: That is correct, Mr. Sanders.  Should I offer my proposition or would you prefer to offer yours?
Mr. Sanders: I know what you want and I know how you go about getting what you want.  I understand the importance of this deal, for my sake.  Im prepared to give you my full forty-precent.
Mr. Beguer: In exchange?
Mr. Sanders: Nothing.
(Sanders pulls out an envelope and hands it to Berguer)
Ive completely signed over all my rights.  You have full control.  (beat) Dont look so alarmed.  Im giving you exactly what you wish.
Mr. Berguer: Why no fuss?  Surely, there must be something you desire?
Mr. Sanders: I understand your power Mr. Berguer.  I know how you go about your business.  Ive thought over this quite a bit these past few weeks. I believe Im making a very smart, successful decision with you.  Am I not?
Mr: Berguer: I wouldnt disagree, Mr. Sanders.
(pause.)
Mr. Sanders: Will that be all?
Mr. Berguer:  Indeed.  (beat) You are a much more dangerous man than I previously imagined.  There is a great deal of respect that divides our interests.
Mr. Sanders: I appreciate your modesty.
Mr. Berguer: Enjoy the rest of the party.
Mr. Sanders: Good evening.
